This is a replication of the paper "The Hydra effect: Emergent self-repair in large language models". I could not find first or third party written code for this _very_ interesting experiment, so decided to write my own. Hope it is useful to you, and please feel freeto contact me if you've got any questions, or want to improve this code.
