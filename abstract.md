### Abstract Interpretation

The abstract describes a study on the internal mechanics of language model computations, specifically focusing on a phenomenon named the "Hydra effect". This effect refers to a compensatory mechanism within language models where the ablation (or removal) of one attention layer causes another layer to increase its compensatory action, effectively "repairing" itself. Additionally, the study looks at the roles of late Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) in moderating outputs to prevent overfitting to the most likely token. The ablation studies show that language model layers are relatively independent, with each layer's modifications affecting only a few others. This resilience is observed even in models that haven't been trained with dropout techniques, suggesting that language models have inherent self-repair capabilities that help maintain performance stability.

### Interpretation from a "Everything is Computation and Information" Perspective

From the perspective that "everything is computation and information," the abstract highlights the intrinsic computational resilience and adaptability of language models. In this view, the "Hydra effect" exemplifies how computational systems (language models, in this case) are designed or evolve to ensure continuity and efficiency of information processing even when part of the system is compromised. This can be seen as a parallel to fault-tolerance in distributed computing systems where redundancy allows the system to continue functioning despite failures. The study's findings suggest that language models not only compute probabilities for next-word predictions but also actively manage information flow across their layers to mitigate the impact of any disruptions. This emphasizes the models' capability to reconfigure themselves dynamically, akin to self-organizing systems in computation, which adjust their processing pathways to optimize performance without external intervention.
